# Weather Graphs

[Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhHSzXrtIA)

A simple app made with React Native and TypeScript that showcases different cities' daily weathers.

The only challenge in this project was making a list of graphs that works smoothly. Luckily, after searching for some time I found a good graph library which I turned into a component that works with TypeScript.
